<ul> celebrate the diversity of religions in Bath and the surrounding district;
<ul> demonstrate dialogue among religions in Bath and the surrounding district;
<ul> enrich the spiritual life of Bath and the surrounding district by promoting harmony between people of different faiths;
<ul> encourage public bodies, including Council, health and educational institutions, to reflect interfaith principles in their policies and actions; 
<ul> act as a resource-centre for information about local faith communities; and 
<ul> aspire to the values and ideals set out in the Act of Commitment developed by faith communities of the UK.
