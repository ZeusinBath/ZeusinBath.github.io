## General Principles

We see all human beings as of equal value. In our different ways we pray for peace or hold peace in our thoughts and actions. We look for practical ways we can build bridges and contribute to peace and harmonious living among diverse people and build a better future. We believe good inter faith work has a valuable role to play here. 

As an inter faith group we respect the right to hold different views, but we can never condone violence in the name of any ideology, and we call out the wrongness of using the name of God or any worldview to justify atrocities. 

We oppose dehumanisation of any sort, whether on grounds of faith, ethnicity or any form of prejudice or “othering”.

We find proselytising, evangelism, or pressure to convert others to any worldview problematic and unhelpful for good inter faith relations.

We value and want to learn more about the deep historic links between many of our faith traditions. To counteract tribal tendencies we seek out and highlight shared values in our faith traditions such as compassion, justice, integrity and the dignity of all people. 

We recognise the limitations of language in making such principles absolute, and accept that this statement of principles is likely to evolve. We celebrate the universal human values at the heart of the world’s faith, ethical and philosophical traditions.
