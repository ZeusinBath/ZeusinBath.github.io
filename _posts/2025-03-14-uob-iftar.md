March 12 saw a blessed coming together of Bath and Islamic tradition. In the month of Ramadan. William, Aiham and Narinder from the Bath Inter Faith Group all attended the Bath University Islamic Society's Annual Grand Iftar. Narinder is Lead Chaplain at the RUH. Aiham is the Muslim Chaplain and also the Muslim faith representative on the inter faith group. 

Iftar is a lavish celebration in which the faithful break the Ramadan fast after dusk with speeches, prayer and a superb feast. 

We were in very good company of civic dignitaries, other faith representatives and young Islamic students, many of them studying science and engineering. We noted the significance in the history of Western science engineering and maths of the learnings about  astronomy, astrology, alchemy, maths and medicine brought back from the Islamic world in the c11th by Adelard of Bath, regarded in England as the greatest scholar of his time. 

The evening was opened with a speech by Bath inter faith group Patron Lord Lieutenant of Somerset Mohammed Habedat Saddiq. Speaking as the King's representative, the Lord Lieutenant stressed the commitment of the King Charles to protecting the diversity of religions, cultures, traditions and beliefs in Britain. 

Many thanks to the Bath Uni SU Islamic Society for an enjoyable and instructive evening. #bathuniversity #bathinterfaith #islam #lordlieutenant #Ramadan #iftar #bathuniversitysu
