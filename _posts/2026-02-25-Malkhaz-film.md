Imagine a Christian Cathedral that responds to growing hatred and intolerance by constructing a synagogue and a mosque to bring faiths together. That's exactly what Bishop Malkhaz Songulashvili has done in Tbilisi, Georgia.

Now Bath IFG, in collaboration with Bath Preservation Trust, is excited to present one of the only UK showings of a new film about the Peace Project. You can even meet Bishop Malkhaz, who will join us for the showing. It's 1600 on 28 March at the Museum of Bath Architecture, The Countess of Huntingdon's Chapel, The Vineyards.
