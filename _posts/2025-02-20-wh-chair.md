At the 2025 Bath Inter Faith Group AGM William Heath, a Bath Quaker, was elected as the new chair. He replaces Methodist David Musgrave, who steps down after five years of valuable service. 

Members also voted in Jacky Wise, the Chaplain of St John Foundation, as vice chair.

Bath Inter Faith Group, which was established some thirty years ago, seeks to celebrate the religious diversity and spiritual life of Bath, whilst deepening understanding and friendship across all faiths and none.

The new chair William Heath said: “I’d like to thank and pay tribute to David, our outgoing chair, for all he has done over these past years. I look forward to building on all his good work. We represent people of all faiths involved in the daily life of our city and its surroundings. We will be looking at deepening our involvement in that daily life, extending our inter faith relations work, and strengthening the voice of all faiths within our communities.”

Jane O'Hara continues as Secretary, and Iris Segall as Treasurer.
