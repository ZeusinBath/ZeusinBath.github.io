**Optional intro paragraph** (1–2 sentences summarising the story).

At the recent Bath inter faith group strategy meeting held at St John Foundation we considered the remarks Charles Windsor made to UK faith leaders before his coronation as King (see below).

We agreed the King's remarks provide the clearest possible mandate for the importance of inter faith work in our communities. Bath, where the first King of all England was crowned, has unique inter faith history and traditions. 

So we look forward next month to discussing the King's commitment and exploring how it can be followed up in Bath with our Patron Mohammed Siddiq, the Lord Lieutenant of Somerset.

[The King's remarks to faith leaders](https://www.royal.uk/kings-remarks-faith-leaders)

*I have always thought of Britain as a ‘community of communities.’  That has led me to understand that the Sovereign has an additional duty – less formally recognized but to be no less diligently discharged. It is the duty to protect the diversity of our country, including by protecting the space for Faith itself and its practice through the religions, cultures, traditions and beliefs to which our hearts and minds direct us as individuals. This diversity is not just enshrined in the laws of our country, it is enjoined by my own faith. 

As a member of the Church of England, my Christian beliefs have love at their very heart. By my most profound convictions, therefore – as well as by my position as Sovereign – I hold myself bound to respect those who follow other spiritual paths, as well as those who seek to live their lives in accordance with secular ideals. 

The beliefs that flourish in, and contribute to, our richly diverse society differ.  They, and our society, can only thrive through a clear collective commitment to those vital principles of freedom of conscience, generosity of spirit and care for others which are, to me, the essence of our nationhood.  I am determined, as King, to preserve and promote those principles across all communities, and for all beliefs, with all my heart.*
