Bath Abbey hosted the inauguration of the new Mayor of Bath Bharat Pankhania on Sat 7 2025. It was a joyous civic occasion and - as the new Mayor himself pointed out, to resounding applause in the Abbey - a celebration of diversity, equality and inclusion. 

The Mayor of Bath is Patron of Bath inter faith group, along with the Lord Lieutenant of Somerset. He is the first Mayor in the history of Bath to choose a chaplain who is not Christian. 

A medical doctor, senior clinical lecturer at Exeter University and visiting professor at Marjon University, the new Mayor was born Hindu to Gujurati-speaking parents from Kenya. He self-describes his leanings as more humanist-Quaker. 

His chosen theme for the year is “education as empowerment”. He replaces outgoing Mayor Cllr Michelle O’Doherty, whose theme was “a home for all”.

Guests were welcomed by the Rector Guy Bridgewater to the Abbey, which sits at the heart of the community and is now after major refurbishment heated by water from Bath’s famous hot springs. The Mayor’s chosen chaplain, the humanist Isabel Russo, spoke powerfully about compassion and integrity, common values which humanists share with the great faiths. It was a notable demonstration of shared values across different traditions, and of civic unity in face of common challenges. 

Guests then departed the Abbey for a civic reception at the Guildhall to mark the start of an exciting year for our new Patron.

The Mayor’s speech and also the chaplain’s are worth reading in full:
