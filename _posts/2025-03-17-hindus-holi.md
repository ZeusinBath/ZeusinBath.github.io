Bath's Hindus celebrated spring and the eternal and divine love of the deities Radha and Krishna in a colourful Holi festival on 15 March. Prayers were said and devotional offerings made in the temple to large avatars of the gods, before a sacred figure liberally daubed with dry paint was carried round outdoors. 

Guests were then generously fed with vegetarian dishes prepared by Susmita's restaurant, before the faithful daubed each other with brightly coloured dry paint powders while children let rip at each other with super soakers. 

Thanks to Ashish and the whole Hindu community for the invitations.
