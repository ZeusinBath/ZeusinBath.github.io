Inter faith week 2025 started with a beautiful event at Christ Church, Julian Road. It was conceived and organised by the Spirit of Peace charity, working with Bath Inter Faith Group, Christ Church and others. 

The music was exceptional — not only from the talented church choir, but also from the Rainbow Steel Band, bansuri, tabla, harp, and Jewish East European violin. The food was delicious, and the fellowship heartwarming.

We heard moving stories of faith journeys and practices from different traditions. The atmosphere was one of mutual respect and curiosity. There was no pressure, no comparisons, just listening and learning. There was a genuine openness, free from prejudice or superiority. It was a space where friendships were formed across faith and cultural lines, and where understanding grew.

Events like this remind us that building bridges through dialogue and shared experience is a powerful path to social cohesion. It’s far more enriching than living in isolation or fear of difference.
