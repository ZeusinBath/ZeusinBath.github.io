Bath IFG patron Lord Lieutenant Mohammed Siddiq and chair William Heath were among guests invited to celebrate Iftar at the Bath mosque Weds 19 March. They joined guests including High Sheriff Rob Beckley and the Bishop of Bath and Wells Michael Beasley. 

The Bishop and High Sheriff recalled happy memories of service in Muslim countries. The Lord Lieutenant pointed out he was not a guest at all, as this was his home mosque. 

William Heath reminded the faithful of Bath's unique and deep interfaith traditions, including Adelard of Bath - credited as the greatest scholar of his age - bringing the wisdom of Islamic and Christian scholars in Arabic countries to England to revolutionise astronomy, astrology, alchemy, maths philosophy and medicine. Our community still needs young Muslims to bring their insights and understanding today, he said, confronted as we are by rising hatred including anti-semitism and islamophobia. 

The guests were treated to a splendid fast-breaking feast before leaving their hosts to evening prayers.
