Bishop Malkhaz Songulashvili is a champion of concrete inter faith action. Troubled by rising homophobia, Islamophobia and anti-semitism in his native Georgia he built a synagogue and a mosque in his Cathedral, despite significant opposition from the government and orthodox faiths. 

To make life easier for himself he would not take money from the Jewish community for the synagogue, but only for th emosque. And similarly he would not take Muslim funds for the mosque, but only for the synagogue. He did it. 
It's a beautiful and inspiring story, and he recently spoke to Bath IFG members Eve Salomon and William Heath. There's a short article here - https://wmheath.substack.com/p/inter-faith-action-in-tblisi and a one-hour podcast here - https://soundcloud.com/wmheath/inter-faith-basics-bishop

Would something like his Peace Project work here? There are plenty of underutilised religious spaces. 

Bath IFG plans to stay in touch with Bishop Malkhaz, and we'd be very interested to get your comments on his project.
