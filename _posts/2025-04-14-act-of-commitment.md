Bath inter faith group remains faithful to the millennial Act of Commitment, which was organised at the time by the now defunct UK Inter Faith Network working with HMG's DCMS. 

Staying true to the Act of Commitment remains part of the Bath IFG's aims as set out in its constitution. See original text below: 


**Text of the Act of Commitment (from Jan 2000)**

*In a world scarred by the evils of war, racism, injustice and poverty, we offer this joint Act of Commitment as we look to our shared future. 

We commit ourselves, as people of many faiths, to work together for the common good, uniting to build a better society, grounded in values and ideals we share: community, personal integrity, a sense of right and wrong, learning, wisdom and love of truth, care and compassion, justice and peace, respect for one another, for the earth and its creatures. 

We commit ourselves, in a spirit of friendship and co-operation, to work together alongside all who share our values and ideals, to help bring about a better world now and for generations to come.*
