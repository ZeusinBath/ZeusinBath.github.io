Are you interested in matters of faith and good with social media? Bath Inter Faith Group (IFG) needs a volunteer to help with our social media. 

Bath IFG organises around a dozen events a year: talks, walks, music, socials. It has a web site, a Facebook page with 450 followers and a YouTube channel. 

We need someone to help us use these and other social media to connect with our growing base of members, to keep them informed of news and events and to develop a “voice of faith” to connect with secular society. 

It’s fascinating work, sorely needed, at a really interesting time of rapid change in inter faith activity nationally. There promises to be plenty of interesting material to share in coming months. Basic time commitment needed probably an hour a week; more if you attend events. 

If that might be you please email mailto:chair@BathIFG.org.uk
