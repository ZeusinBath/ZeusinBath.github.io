Reverend Jacky Wise, chaplain at St John Foundation, has stepped down as Vice Chair and from the Executive Committee of the Bath Inter Faith Group. We thank her for her insights, efforts and energies, and for the practical support she has offered. This has included hosting Exec meetings and leading our strategic review. 

Jacky tells us she is shifting her focus to concentrate on her core work at St John’s Foundation. “I’ve really enjoyed working alongside you all and the conversations we have had and the friendships fostered,” she said.

The role of vice chair is taken over for the rest of this year by Reverend Prebendary Narinder Tegally. Narinder is Lead Chaplain at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, and Deputy Lieutenant for Somerset.

Update: Jacky has been given the added responsibility of Assistant Area Dean for Bath. St John’s Foundation says: “This honour recognises her valued contributions to the Diocese of Bath and Wells and her respected role among city clergy. In this role, she will support the Area Dean in caring for clergy and developing mission and ministry across the city.”
