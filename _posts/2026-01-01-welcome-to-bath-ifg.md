Here's a thing to consider for 2026. If you think it's a good idea that people of different faiths and cultures get together in friendship to do fun and worthwhile things why not join Bath Inter Faith Group? 

[It's free, and there are zero obligations](https://www.bathifg.org.uk/join/)

Next year Bath IFG activities will include socials, choir evening, walks, remembering the Holocaust and a trip to Tbilisi Georgia. 

Last year we learned about Sufism, shared perspectives on assisted dying with our MP, met the Mayor and Lord Lieutenant, talked about the Middle East, and enjoyed good food and music. 

We unite round the Golden Rule, the millenial act of commitment and the King's call for "clear collective commitment to those vital principles of freedom of conscience, generosity of spirit and care for others which are, to me, the essence of our nationhood".

It's wholesome stuff, much needed at a time of wilful misunderstanding about other faiths and cultures when some would try to divide us...
