**Bath IFG welcomes its first Rastafari and Ethiopian Orthodox Exec member**

The Bath Interfaith Group (IFG) welcomes Ras Benji as the first Rastafari and Ethiopian Orthodox Church member to its Executive Committee. Benji is a committed spiritual servant of HIM Haile Selassie I, who lived as a war refugee in Bath 1936-1940. A Rastafari, Benji was also baptised into the EOTC in Addis Ababa last year. He was given the baptismal name Haile Selassie (which means “power of the Trinity”). 

Emperor Haile Selassie’s former home Fairfield House is a vibrant multi-faith and multi cultural centre. Ras Benji is operations manager at Fairfield House Bath and leads its highly rated Sunday historic tours. 

Meanwhile Charles Hayward is stepping down from the Bath IFG Exec. “I have really appreciated being involved in BIFG for the last 18 years or so. Its charitable purpose (namely, interfaith activity) is close to my heart, and I look forward to supporting you and the committee by continuing to attend BIFG events”, he said. 

Charles was for many years active with the Christian Science church Bath, but that church has since closed. Charles continues as co-organiser of the Bath IFG pilgrimage, which takes place this year Sun 14 Sept as part of the Bathscape Walking Festival.
