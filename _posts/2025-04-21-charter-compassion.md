Just in time for International Golden Rule Day Bath inter faith group signed the Charter for Compassion.

Centred on the Golden Rule - “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” - the Charter is based on work by theologian and writer Karen Armstrong. It urges the peoples and religions of the world to embrace the core value of compassion. 

Now available in 30 languages it has been endorsed by more than 2m people.

Bath IFG joins it just at a time when the Charter is about to be revised for the first time since its original launch in 2009. 

We look forward to participating in this first major refresh.
