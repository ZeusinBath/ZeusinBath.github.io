It is with deep sorrow that we mourn the passing of His Holiness Pope Francis—a faithful servant of Christ whose life, ministry, and message touched hearts far beyond the walls of the Roman Catholic Church. 

We give thanks for his witness and pray he may rest in peace and rise in glory.
Pope Francis was a shepherd who never stopped walking with those on the margins. From the streets of Buenos Aires to the halls of the Vatican, he bore constant witness to the God-given dignity of every person—especially those who are overlooked, misunderstood, or silenced. In doing so, he not only embodied the teachings of Christ but gave courage to many of us who have, in our own faith journeys, experienced exclusion or judgment. His leadership helped us believe again that the Church can be a place of belonging.

As the first Latin American and Jesuit Pope, his voice resonated with people across the world—not because he sought to please, but because he spoke truth with humility, hope, and love. His heart was always turned toward the least, the lost, and the last: migrants, the poor, the displaced, and those historically left outside the embrace of religious institutions. He championed environmental justice, challenged indifference, and reminded us that to follow Jesus is to walk the hard path of service, mercy, and listening.

He chose the name Francis after the saint who loved the poor—and indeed, Pope Francis lived simply and gave generously. He met resistance, yet never wavered in his vision of a more inclusive church. A church not merely concerned with progress, but with presence: being present to one another in our difference, our diversity, and our shared humanity.

In this moment of loss, we carry his legacy forward—not just in words, but in how we treat one another. May his witness stir us to speak up for justice, to walk alongside those who feel they have no voice, and to build bridges between faiths and communities. His was a life poured out in service of the Gospel.

May Pope Francis rest now in the peace he preached, and may his hope continue to live in us.
