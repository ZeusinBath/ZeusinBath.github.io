*Revd Nigel Rawlinson, outgoing University of Bath Chaplain and Interfaith Lead, spoke to a gathering held by Bath University Islamic Society (BUIS) at the Bath Mosque. Here is an abridged text of his speech.*

For the last nine years, since starting here as University Chaplain, I regularly used the soundbite "I am a Christian Chaplain working on a secular campus in an interfaith way".
One of my first actions in 2017 was to form the University of Bath Interfaith Forum (UBIF) with the then Chair of BUIS.  This was the launch of our interfaith thinking, and then the forming of the University of Bath Interfaith Community (UBIC) in 2022.

As I come to the end of my nine years, I wonder about two things:

First: are we secular?  The amazing international community we have at the University is telling us something different, I think.  People from other countries show that faith is still of foundational importance to them.  Is the UK’s ‘secular tag’ therefore out of touch?  Yes, I think so. I could say ‘Faith is back on the agenda’, but there we go – I am talking like “an Englishman”!  For many, faith has never left the agenda.

Second; looking ahead, an interfaith understanding of each other is surely crucial for our survival, isn’t it? When we have respect for each other, that brings hope – an existential hope.  

On October 10th 2023, 3 days after the conflict in Gaza began, several students from the Islamic and Arab Committees came to see me, asking if they could meet their fellow Jewish students.  They were declaring their total opposition to warfare as a way of resolving conflict.  This year’s students have continued this philosophy. And, with the Lord Lieutenant, Mohammed Saddiq’s support, we have done it. They have met together with the Chair of the Jewish Society, who is also here today, and members of the that society.  I know this was hard for some, but we did it.

In our present era we do not want bipolar politics.  The yes/no approach causes so much division.  The world is much more complex and nuanced than that.

The world is watching.  We see the continuing horror of Gaza, reported by reliable third parties such as the English trained surgeon working there.  The Israeli government is continuing to be driven by an Old Testament scriptural zeal.  

In my faith tradition we are in a new, (New Testament) era. The scriptures from the early Old Testament in the daily readings set for the Christian church, and telling of the early Israelite history, have been hard to read recently.  

Why is the world so impotent in stopping the Israeli government? This is in turn fuelling the next generation of Arab hatred.  This will be a question we will have to ask in the future.
And then, this weekend (1-6-25), new war-talk.  The British government is planning to invest in American warplanes armed with nuclear warheads.  That is bonkers!  So dangerous.  

So, in conclusion, the interfaith understanding we have built at the University of Bath is one of the most fulfilling aspects of my nine years as University Chaplain.  It is surely pointing to a new way – the only way - for my grandchildren and your children to enjoy a better world.
So, keep going please!  Bring us oldies with you.  I pledge my support.  

With the Imam’s permission, can I pray? I will use a scripture written by King Solomon, and known to the Christian, Jewish, and Islamic faith traditions: Psalm 127 verse 1 – 

*Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labour in vain. 
Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain.

Dear God, the God we believe in…
We are building together,
We are watching out for each other – our fellow human beings… 
Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labour in vain. 
Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain.

Please help.

AMEN*
