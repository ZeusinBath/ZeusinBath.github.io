Wera Hobhouse MP heard a diverse range of faith perspectives on assisted dying on 29 May in an intense, often passionate and always respectful conversation organised by Bath Inter Faith Group. 

As draft legislation approaches its second reading we heard about suffering, the sanctity of life, legal jeopardy for professionals and loved ones and the "slippery slope" of permissive legislation. "Agonistic dialogue" was the apt phrase offered by Buddhist chaplain Dr Jan Gentaku Mojsa, to describe respectful conversation which leans into conflict constructively. She argued for mindfulness in life. 

The Roman Catholic speaker, RUH consultant John Bunni,  spoke clearly against assisted dying on grounds of his faith and his professional experience. Humanist Isabel Russo advocated for greater literacy about end of life and death, and argued against prolonging suffering. Both evidenced deep compassion in their professional work, which had touched several local people in the room.

Islam offers no simple answer to this, said Imam Mohammed Gamal. Two of the higher objectives in Islam are the preservation of life, and the preservation of free will. In the case of someone wishing to stop living in suffering and indignity these two principles are not easily reconciled. 

There were lively interventions and questions from guests, including deeply personal accounts of end of life of loved ones. 

All present were deeply moved, some even changed their minds. After a journey of deep reflection the Bath MP said she is minded to vote in favour of the new law, and the evening's discussion did not alter that view. But there was no doubt in the room that she had listened carefully and respectfully to a range of faith perspectives and all present had learned a lot. 

Guests were refreshed with home made cake and home-grown apple juice from IFG members. The event was recorded. The Bath IFG gained several new members.
