**Church suffers death of President and act of violence in same week**

Bath inter faith group is deeply moved by momentous and tragic events affecting the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) in recent days. 

First, in a momentous moment for the church, their long-standing prophet and president Russell M. Nelson was “called home”, dying aged 101 last Saturday. He was the world’s oldest leader of a global faith organization. The church has published details of tribute broadcast and events honouring the late President. 

The very next day, in what the church described as a “tragic act of violence”, a gunman opened fire at the chapel in Grand Blanc, Michigan, USA. This happened during Sunday worship service. There were casualties, and the building was set on fire. 
Mormons are well established locally, and the Bath Ward congregation celebrated its 30th Anniversary just last weekend. 

All the faiths represented in the Bath IFG reject violence. We wish to express solidarity and friendship with brothers and sisters in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in their pain and suffering at these two events.
