Bath IFG took part in the first Bath Refugee Festival. Organised by Sudafest, the event took place at Fairfield House, former home of Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I. 

Guests enjoyed inspiring speeches by the new Mayor of Bath Bharat Pankania, Abdullah Miri and others, and terrific Sudanese and Ukrainian food and music, in the perfect setting of the former home of the Emperor. himself a war refugee during his time in Bath. 

A steady stream of visitors including refugees and new IFG members came to the Bath IFG table, sat with us, discussed matters of faith, and took information about various faith traditions available in Bath, while children did small crafts. 

These were deep, moving conversations. It was a really worthwhile and well-organised day.
