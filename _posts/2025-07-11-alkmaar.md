The Bath Alkmaar Twinning Association (BATA) is celebrating 80 years of international friendship by marking Alkmaar Week 7-11 July 2025 and raising awareness of the city of Bath’s link to the city of Alkmaar in the Netherlands.

In 1940, Eli Prins, a young Dutch Jewish man – a playwright, theatre producer and activist – decided to escape from the advancing German army about to occupy the Netherlands. He could not have guessed that his brave but hazardous journey to England would lead to an enduring friendship between two previously unconnected cities: click here for the full story. 

As part of the weeklong activities there was a small remembrance service at St Swithun’s church in Bathford, to mark the life and legacy of Eli Prins, who was Jewish and married Ida, a Christian. They are buried side by side in this lovely unassuming parish churchyard. 

We felt honoured to be present at the service. Eli and Ida Prins’ son as well as the Mayor of Alkmaar each said a few words. Flower bulbs were planted in front of the graves before the delegation continued to their next commitment in this extraordinary week of celebrating inter faith friendship, and long-lasting ties between two cities and their people.
