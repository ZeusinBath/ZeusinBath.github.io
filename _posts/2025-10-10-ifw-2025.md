**This year’s Inter Faith Week theme is “Community: together we serve”**

Inter faith week 2025: 9-16 Nov

The UK’s strength lies in its diversity, say the organisers of Inter Faith Week 2025 (9-16 Nov). This year's theme is “Community: Together We Serve”.  With the closure of the UK Inter Faith Network in 2024, IFW 2025 is run by a consortium of other national inter faith organisations. They put out an statement deploring the rising tide of hatred and intolerance, with support from faith leaders including Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Bahá’í, Sikh and Pagan.
